## Auto Save

When Auto Save is enabled (`Alt+S`), content is saved whenever you pause typing for longer than 4 seconds.


## Settings

User settings are stored in a text file in the `AppData` folder. Placing settings in a plain file allows sharing of settings on different installations. You can also access some, but not all of settings by clicking on the, `Gear` icon in the title bar.

Typically, this folder is located at `C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\Markdown Edit\user_settings.json`. Pressing `F9` will open this file in the system's Notepad editor. It should look something like this:

    {
        "EditorBackground": "#F7F4EF",
        "EditorForeground": "Black",
        "EditorFontFamily": "Segoe UI",
        "EditorFontSize": 14.0
    }

When you change settings and save this file, Markdown Edit will immediately update to reflect the changes.

Colors can be defined as RBG values, like the `EditorBackground` setting, or using the predefined names (like the `EditorForground` setting). Acceptable predefined names are listed [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.media.colors(v=vs.110).aspx).

If you delete this file, Markdown Edit will restore it with the default settings.


## Snippets

Snippets allow the quick insertion of words or phrases by typing a trigger word and then the `TAB` key. This can improve the speed and proficiency of writing documents. Snippets are stored in a text file that can be edited by pressing `F6`.

Snippets are activated by typing the trigger word and pressing `TAB`.

Snippets consist of a single line starting with:

  - a single trigger word (can include non alpha-numerics)
  - one or more spaces
  - text that will replace the word
  
Example

    mde  [Markdown Edit](http://mike-ward.net/markdown)
    
With this snippet defined, open Markdown Edit and type

    mde[TAB]

Where `[TAB]` is the tab key.

The `mde` text is replaced by

    [Markdown Edit](http://mike-ward.net/markdown)
    
### Snippet Substitution Parameters

- $END$ - Positions the cursor after insertion. For instance

      mde  [Markdown $END$ Edit](http://mike-ward.net/markdown)

  positions the cursor between *Markdown* and *Edit*

- $DATE$ - is replaced with the current date and time

- $DATE("format")$ - format is any valid .NET date format (<http://www.dotnetperls.com/datetime-format>)

- $NAME$ - Where `NAME` can be any word including underscores. When the snippet is triggered, the parameter will be highlighted waiting for input. There can be multiple substitution parameters in a snippet. Here's how the *link* snippet is defined:

      link  [$link_text$]($link_url$) $END$
  
  When triggered, the snippet will expand as `[link_text](link_url)`, with `link_text`, highlighted. Type the link text and press `TAB`. Now the `link_url` text is highlighted. Enter the link URL and press `Enter`. The cursor moves one space past the closing parenthesis. 
  
  The description sounds more complicated than it is. Try it and you'll see that it's an easy and natural workflow.

- `\n` - insert a new line
  
If you delete this file, Markdown Edit will restore it with the default snippets.


## Templates

You can change the appearance of the preview view by changing the user template file. User templates work similar to user settings. The template file is stored in the `AppData` Folder as `user_template.html`. It can be quickly accessed by pressing `F8`. Edit it as you see fit. 

It is strongly recommended that you keep the IE9 meta tag in the `<head>` section.

A `<div>` with an ID of `contents` is required. This is where the translated markup is inserted into the document.

When you change settings and save this file, Markdown Edit will immediately update to reflect the changes.

If you delete this file, Markdown Edit will restore the default template.


## Spell Checking

Pressing `F7` will toggle spell checking. Spell checking is done as you type. Right-click on the word to get suggested spellings or to add to the dictionary.

The custom dictionary is a simple text file. It stored in the same folder as the user settings and user templates. It can be accessed and edited  by pressing `Shift+F7`.

Markdown Edit ships with dictionaries for many languages. Set the dictionary by pressing `F9`. The dictionaries are stored in the installation folder under `Spell Check\Dictionaries`.


## Themes

Markdown Edit has a rudimentary theme system. Themes, control the appearance of the editor and syntax highlighting. The UI  elements (i.e. dialogs) are not affected. 

Out of the box, Markdown comes with several themes which can be accessed by pressing `Ctrl+T`. Selecting a theme updates your user settings. You can further edit the theme by opening your user settings (`F9`) and editing the theme section. This is the recommended way to create a new theme.

Themes are located in the installation directory under `\Themes`.

If you create an awesome theme, send it to me and I'll add it to the distribution. I'm a lousy artist. :)


## Key Bindings

You can change most of the key bindings. Press `F10', make your changes and save. The changes take effect immediately.

If you delete this file, Markdown Edit will create a new one with default bindings.


## Etc.

  - Line numbers can be enabled/disabled in the settings file
  - List continuations - When editing lists, pressing enter will add the next list marker. Works with numbered lists as well.
  - When opening recent documents, Markdown Edit will scroll to the last saved position. This can be disabled in the setting if not desired.


## Limitations

  - Only supports CommonMark
  - Single document Interface
  - Syntax highlighting does not recognize multiple-line constructs. It uses regular expressions which don't understand the underlying Markdown constructs.  I'm hoping that as CommonMark matures a syntax parser (like PEG) will emerge.
  - I wrote it ;)
